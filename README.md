# Push-to-Light x3: Multi-Button LED Control with Arduino

This beginner-friendly Arduino project demonstrates how to control 3 LEDs using 3 push buttons. Each button controls one LED. When you press a button, the corresponding LED turns on. When you release it, the LED turns off.

## üß∞ Components Used:
- Arduino UNO  
- 3 LEDs  
- 3 Push buttons  
- 3 Resistors 220Œ©   
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires (connection wires between components)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
- Each button is connected to a digital input pin  
- When a button is pressed, it sends a HIGH signal to Arduino  
- Arduino then sends a HIGH signal to the corresponding LED pin  
- The LED turns on while the button is pressed  
- When released, the LED turns off immediately

## üìò Concepts Learned:
- Digital input (reading push button state)  
- Digital output (controlling LEDs)  
- Basic breadboard wiring  
- Real-time condition checking in Arduino loop
